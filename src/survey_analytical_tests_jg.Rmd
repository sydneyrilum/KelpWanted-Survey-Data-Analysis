## Knowledge 

We test the relationship between people's familiarity with aquaculture and their perceptions of seaweed aquaculture using a chi-squared test. 

*10 & 13. perception and Familiarity* 

*Question:* Does familiarity with aquaculture influence their  of aquaculture? 

*Null Hypothesis (H0):*  There is no association between the two variables (familiarity and perceptions) i.e. they are independent 

*Statistical Test:* Chi-square test of Q10 & Q13

*Test Statistic:* P-value > 0.05 


#### Q10 (familiarity) v. Q13 (perception of seaweed aq)
```{r 10v.13 dataframe, table and plot}
#create subset from tidy filtered data
#keep only question 10 and 13
k_p <- survey_data_tidy_sbv_long_filtered %>% 
  select(response_id, question, answer) %>% 
  filter(question == "q10"|
           question == "q13") %>% 
#switch to wide format with response id as the link
 spread(question, answer) %>% 
  mutate(q13 = fct_relevel(q13, c(c("Very Negative", "Negative","Neutral","Positive", "Very Positive", "Unsure/Not familiar")))) %>% 
  mutate(q10 = fct_relevel(q10, c(c("Very familiar", "Basic understanding", "Heard of it, but don't know details", "Never heard of it"))))

ggplot(k_p, aes(fill= q13, x = q10))+
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")+
  scale_x_discrete(labels= function(x) str_wrap(x, width = 10))+
  scale_fill_manual(values =c("#D7191C", "#FDAE61", "#FFFFBF", "#ABD9E9","#2C7BB6", "#999999")) +
  labs(y = "count",
       x = "Familiarity with Aquaculture")+
  theme(legend.title = element_text("Perception of Seaweed Aquaculture")) +
  theme_minimal()
  
#put counts into table format
k_p_table<- k_p %>% 
  tabyl(q10, q13) 
```

One key assumption of the chi-square test is that 80% of the cells must have an expected value of 5 or greater. Only 14 of the 24 cells meet this requirement (58%), therefore violating the assumptions of the chi-square test. We will use the maximum liklihood chi-square test to also understand the relationship bewteen the two variables. 


```{r 10 v. 13 chi squared test}
# Use `column_to_rownames` to convert counts table to a contingency table (makes `q10` column entries into stored rownames)
k_p_ct <- k_p_table %>% 
  column_to_rownames(var = "q10")

# Chi-square test for independence: Is there an association between support for aquaculture and word choice?
knowledge_perception_x2 <- chisq.test(k_p_ct)
knowledge_perception_x2

# Get the chi-square test results to call outputs in-line
k_p_x2_tidy <- tidy(knowledge_perception_x2)
```

The p-squared value `r round(k_p_x2_tidy[1, 2], 2)` is less than alpha (0.05) indicating the null hypothesis- that the two variables are independent- failed. However, there were some counts that were less than 5 which indicates there should be additional study. However, the data violates an assumption of the chi-square test so we conduct the maximum likelihood test below. 

We will aggregate 'very negative' and 'negative' and 'very positive' and 'postiive' and run the chi-square with these groups. 

```{r group Q13 responses}
#create subset from tidy filtered data
#keep only question 10 and 13
k_p_grouped <- survey_data_tidy_sbv_long_filtered %>% 
  select(response_id, question, answer) %>% 
  filter(question == "q10"|
           question == "q13") %>% 
#switch to wide format with response id as the link
 spread(question, answer) %>% 
#group responses
    mutate(q13= case_when(
    q13 == "Very Negative" ~ "Negative",
    q13 == "Negative" ~ "Negative",
    q13 =="Neutral" ~ "Neutral",
    q13 == "Positive" ~ "Positive",
    q13 =="Very Positive" ~ "Positive",
    q13 =="Unsure/Not familiar" ~ "Unsure/Not familiar",
  ))

#ggplot(k_p, aes(fill= q13, x = q10))+
 # geom_bar(position = "dodge")+
  #scale_x_discrete(labels= function(x) str_wrap(x, width = 10))+
  #scale_fill_manual(values =c("#D7191C", "#FDAE61", "#FFFFBF", "#ABD9E9","#2C7BB6", "#999999"))
  
#put counts into table format
k_p_grouped_table<- k_p_grouped %>% 
  tabyl(q10, q13) 
```

```{r Q13 grouped chi-squared}
k_p_grouped_ct <- k_p_grouped_table%>% 
  column_to_rownames(var = "q10")

# Chi-square test for independence: Is there an association between support for aquaculture and word choice?
knowledge_perception_grouped_x2 <- chisq.test(k_p_grouped_ct)
knowledge_perception_grouped_x2

```

When perception is combined into 'negative', 'neutral', 'positive', and 'unsure', the null hypothesis is rejected (p-value= 2.22 x10-7, alpha =0.05) which indicates the variables are dependent. 

We can also use the Fisher's exact test to calculate the exact p-value. **Fisher's test requires a high number of simulations because the value of p is so small. Kept crashing R**

```{r 10 v. 13 Fischer's exact test}
#fisher.test(k_p_ct, workspace = 2e7)
```

#### Q16 (heard about aq) v. Q13 (perception)

```{r dataset Q16(heard of aq) v Q13 }
#create subset from tidy filtered data
#keep only question 16 and 13
k_p_heard <- survey_data_tidy_sbv_long_filtered %>% 
  select(response_id, question, answer) %>% 
  filter(question == "q16"|
           question == "q13") %>% 
#switch to wide format with response id as the link
 spread(question, answer) %>% 
  #group responses
  mutate(q13= case_when(
    q13 == "Very Negative" ~ "Negative",
    q13 == "Negative" ~ "Negative",
    q13 =="Neutral" ~ "Neutral",
    q13 == "Positive" ~ "Positive",
    q13 =="Very Positive" ~ "Positive",
    q13 =="Unsure/Not familiar" ~ "Unsure/Not familiar",
  ))

ggplot(k_p_heard, aes(fill= q13, x = q16))+
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")+
  scale_x_discrete(labels= function(x) str_wrap(x, width = 10))+
  scale_fill_manual(values =c("#D7191C", "#FFFFBF", "#2C7BB6", "#999999"))
  
#put counts into table format
k_p_heard_table<- k_p_heard %>% 
  tabyl(q16, q13) 
```

```{r 16 v. 13 chi squared test}
# Use `column_to_rownames` to convert counts table to a contingency table (makes `q10` column entries into stored rownames)
k_p_heard_ct <- k_p_heard_table %>% 
  column_to_rownames(var = "q16")

# Chi-square test for independence: Is there an association between support for aquaculture and word choice?
k_p_heard_x2 <- chisq.test(k_p_heard_ct)
k_p_heard_x2

# Get the chi-square test results to call outputs in-line
k_p_x2_tidy <- tidy(k_p_heard_x2)
```

The data violate the assumptions of the chi-square test (80% of the expected values >5). The fisher exact test will be used instead. 

```{r 16 v. 13 fisher test}
# Use `column_to_rownames` to convert counts table to a contingency table (makes `q10` column entries into stored rownames)

fisher_Q16 <- fisher.test(k_p_heard_ct)
fisher_Q16 <- tidy(fisher_Q16)
```

The null hypothesis was rejected using the Fisher exact test (p-value = 3..7x10-7, alpha =0.05). There is a relationship between hearning about aquaculture perceptions of aquaculture.

#### Q17 (seen aq) v. Q13 (perception)

```{r dataset Q16(heard of aq) v Q13- grouped}
#create subset from tidy filtered data
#keep only question 16 and 13
k_p_seen <- survey_data_tidy_sbv_long_filtered %>% 
  filter(response_type != 3) %>% 
  select(response_id, question, answer) %>% 
  filter(question == "q17"|
           question == "q13") %>% 
#switch to wide format with response id as the link
 spread(question, answer) %>% 
  #group responses
  mutate(q13= case_when(
    q13 == "Very Negative" ~ "Negative",
    q13 == "Negative" ~ "Negative",
    q13 =="Neutral" ~ "Neutral",
    q13 == "Positive" ~ "Positive",
    q13 =="Very Positive" ~ "Positive",
    q13 =="Unsure/Not familiar" ~ "Unsure/Not familiar",
  ))

ggplot(k_p_seen, aes(fill= q13, x = q17))+
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")+
  scale_x_discrete(labels= function(x) str_wrap(x, width = 10))+
  scale_fill_manual(values =c("#D7191C", "#FFFFBF", "#2C7BB6", "#999999"))
  
#put counts into table format
k_p_seen_table<- k_p_seen %>% 
  tabyl(q17, q13) 
```

The data did not meet the assumptions of the chi-sqare test(80% of expected values >5). Data was tested using the Fisher exact test instead. 

```{r 17 v. 13 fishertest}
# Use `column_to_rownames` to convert counts table to a contingency table (makes `q10` column entries into stored rownames)
k_p_seen_ct <- k_p_seen_table %>% 
  column_to_rownames(var = "q17")

fisher_Q17 <- fisher.test(k_p_seen_ct)
fisher_Q17 <- tidy(fisher_Q17)
```


The Fisher exact test rejected the null hypothesis- that the two variables are independent (p-vale= 0.031, alpha =0.05). 


#### Age v. Perception

In this seciton we will compare age with perception

```{r}
age_perception <- survey_data_tidy_sbv_filtered %>% 
  select(q41,q40, q39, q38, q37, q36, q35, q34, q33, q32, q31) 

dems$q31 <- as.integer(dems$q31)
```

## Regression Models : Relationship between Knowledge and Support 
####Relationship Between knowledge and support

*Question:* Is support related to more familiarity/knowledge of seaweed aquaculture?

*Hypothesis:* Those who are familiar with aquaculture will have more polarized opinions. Those less familiar will have more positive views of kelp aquaculture. 

*Assumptions:* 
- Since Q2,4, 6, 8 are not significantly different, then questions/answers can thus be combined.
- Remove "don't know" answer choice counts

*Statistical Test:* Ordinal logistic regression of perception combined support values (Q2,4,6,8) vs. perception of seaweed aquaculture (Q13)

dependent variable = support (Q2)
independent variable = perception (Q13)


```{r regression table }
# create data frame with Q2 and Q10

ordinal_log_reg_knowledge_data <- survey_data_tidy_sbv_long_filtered %>% 
  filter(question == "q2" | 
         question == "q4" |
         question == "q6" |
         question == "q8" |
         question == "q13") %>%
  mutate(question = case_when( 
    question == "q2" ~ "q2",
    question == "q4" ~ "q2",
    question == "q6" ~ "q2",
    question == "q8" ~ "q2",

  mutate(answer = case_when( 
    answer == "Strongly opposed" ~ -2,
    answer == "Somewhat opposed" ~ -1,
    answer == "Neither opposed nor in support" ~ 0,
    answer == "Somewhat supportive" ~ 1,

    answer == "Unsure/Not familiar" ~ -999)) %>%
  replace_with_na(replace = list(answer = -999))%>% 
  filter(answer != "NA") # remove incomplete responses

```

```{r}
# use spread() to pivot table to wide format
ordinal_log_reg_knowledge <- ordinal_log_reg_knowledge_data %>%

ordinal_log_reg_knowledge_table<- ordinal_log_reg_knowledge %>% 
  tabyl(q2, q13) %>% 
  column_to_rownames(var = "q2")

summary(ordinal_log_reg_knowledge_table)

```


```{r create ordinal logistic model}
#use polr to create a logit model to understand how familiarity influences expansion
m2 <- polr(factor(q2) ~q13, data=ordinal_log_reg_knowledge, Hess =TRUE)
summary(m2)
```


```{r understand odds ratio}
#interpret odds ratio to probabilities. Outside parenthesis are important 
(ci <- confint(m2))
exp(cbind(coef(m2), t(ci)))
```


```{r predicted probabilities to understand odds ratio}
newdf_2 <- data.frame(q13 =c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
(phat <- predict(object = m2, newdf_2, type = "p"))
```




####Relationship Between Perception and Support: 


*Question:* Is support related to more positive perceptions of seaweed aquaculture?

*Hypothesis:* Yes, supporters will have more positive perceptions of seaweed aquaculture.

*Assumptions:* 
- Since Q2,4, 6, 8 are not significantly different, then questions/answers can thus be combined.
- Remove "don't know" answer choice counts

*Statistical Test:* Ordinal logistic regression of perception combined support values (Q2,4,6,8) vs. perception value from Q13 (seaweed aquaculture)


dependent variable = support (Q2)
independent variable = knowledge (Q10)


```{r regression table }
# create data frame with Q2 and Q10

ordinal_log_reg_2_data <- survey_data_tidy_sbv_long_filtered %>% 
  filter(response_type != 3) %>% #filter out self-collected data
  filter(question == "q2" | 
         question == "q4" |
         question == "q6" |
         question == "q8" |
         question == "q10") %>%
  mutate(question = case_when( 
    question == "q2" ~ "q2",
    question == "q4" ~ "q2",
    question == "q6" ~ "q2",
    question == "q8" ~ "q2",
    question == "q10" ~ "q10")) %>% 
  mutate(answer = case_when( 
    answer == "Strongly opposed" ~ -2,
    answer == "Somewhat opposed" ~ -1,
    answer == "Neither opposed nor in support" ~ 0,
    answer == "Somewhat supportive" ~ 1,
    answer == "Strongly supportive" ~ 2,
    answer == "Very familiar" ~ 1,
    answer == "Basic understanding" ~ 2,
    answer == "Heard of it, but don't know details" ~ 3,
    answer == "Never heard of it" ~ 4)) %>%
  filter(answer != "NA") # remove incomplete responses

```

```{r}
# use spread() to pivot table to wide format
ordinal_log_reg_2 <- ordinal_log_reg_2_data %>% 
  select(response_id, question, answer) %>% 
  spread(question, answer) %>% 
  filter(q10 != "NA")  %>% # remove incomplete responses
  filter(q2 != "NA") # remove incomplete responses
  
ordinal_log_reg_2_table<- ordinal_log_reg_2 %>% 
  tabyl(q2, q10) %>% 
  column_to_rownames(var = "q2")

summary(ordinal_log_reg_2_table)

```


```{r create ordinal logistic model}
#use polr to create a logit model to understand how familiarity influences expansion
m1 <- polr(factor(q2) ~q10, data=ordinal_log_reg_2, Hess =TRUE)
summary(m1)
```

The output shows that for respondents who very familiar with aquaculture, the log odds of being unlikely to support aquaculture is 0.9079 points lower than respondents who are not familiar with aquaculture.




```{r understand odds ratio}
#interpret odds ratio. Outside parenthesis are important 
(ci <- confint(m1))
exp(cbind(coef(m1), t(ci)))
```


```{r predicted probabilities to understand odds ratio}
newdf <- data.frame(q10 =c(1, 2, 3, 4))
(phat <- predict(object = m1, newdf, type = "p"))
```
