# Chi-Square Test Assumptions & Hypothesis Testing

A chi-square test for independence will be used to compare proportions/count data collected in the survey and determine whether or not there is an association between word choice/terminology and a residents’ support for kelp aquaculture.

*Assumptions for Chi-Square Test:*

A Chi-Square test of independence is used to determine whether or not there is a significant association between two categorical variables.
This test makes four assumptions:

*Assumption 1:* Both variables are categorical.

It’s assumed that both variables are categorical. That is, both variables take on values that are names or labels.

Our variables: word choice/terminology (either kelp farming, seaweed farming, kelp aquaculture, or seaweed aquaculture) and support for kelp aquaculture (five likert scale categories from strongly opposed to strongly supportive)

*Assumption 2:* All observations are independent.

It’s assumed that every observation in the dataset is independent. That is, the value of one observation in the dataset does not affect the value of any other observation.

*Assumption 3:* Cells in the contingency table are mutually exclusive.

It’s assumed that individuals can only belong to one cell in the contingency table. That is, cells in the table are mutually exclusive – an individual cannot belong to more than one cell.

*Assumption 4:* Expected value of cells should be 5 or greater in at least 80% of cells.

It’s assumed that the expected value of cells in the contingency table should be 5 or greater in at least 80% of cells and that no cell should have an expected value less than 1.



# 10 & 13. perception and Familiarity 

*Question:* Does familiarity with aquaculture influence their perception of aquaculture? 

*Null Hypothesis (H0):*  There is no association between the two variables (familiarity and perceptions)

*Statistical Test:* Chi-square test of Q10 & Q13


```{r dataframe and table creation for analysis}
#create subset from tidy filtered data
#keep only question 10 and 13
k_p <- survey_data_sbv_tidy_filtered %>% 
  select(response_id, question, answer) %>% 
  filter(question == "q10"|

#put counts into table format
k_p_table<- k_p %>%

# Use `column_to_rownames` to convert counts table to a contingency table (makes `q10` column entries into stored rownames)
k_p_ct <- k_p_table %>%

knowledge_perception_x2

# Get the chi-square test results to call outputs in-line
k_p__x2_tidy <- tidy(knowledge_perception_x2)
```

The chi-squared test comparing familiarity with perceptions show that the null hypothesis (there is no relationship between the variables) is false. The p-value is less than 0.05. However, the count in each

Familiarity with aquaculture may be 

#Mann Whitney U Test 
The Mann Whitney U test or Wilcoxon Rank Sum test is a nonparametric test to understand whether two samples come from the same population in independent groups. 

For this analysis, we will link people's support for expanding aquaculture (strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree)

Assumptions: 

1. The underlying population(s) are normally distributed 
 
2. Sample size is large (n>30) for both populations

3. Groups are independent


Null Hypothesis (H0): The two populations are equal 

Hypothesis (H1):The populations are not equal
