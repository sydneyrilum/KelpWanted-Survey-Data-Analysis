# KelpWanted

### Authors: Sydney Rilum, Laurel Wee, Janelle Gaun, & Madeline McEwen

### About: 
This repository contains survey data analysis for a UCSB Bren School of Environmental Science and Management  master's group project that aims to determine public perceptions about seaweed aquaculture in California. Survey analytics will be used to develop a community engagement and outreach strategy for commercial kelp producer, Ocean Rainforest, to utilize as a framework for aquaculture expansion along the California coastline. 

### Survey Question:
What knowledge do Ventura and Santa Barbara County residents have regarding seaweed aquaculture, and what are their perceived benefits and/or risks about aquaculture expansion?

### Survey Hypotheses:
The majority of the general public have not been exposed to the idea of seaweed aquaculture; some are interested in the potentially beneficial and harmful effects of it, however, most will likely not feel connected to the topic. Those who are well versed in the trade-offs of aquaculture will have more polarized opinions.
